# Linux iptables Firewall Configuration

This repository, **linux-labs-portfolio**, contains hands-on Linux labs I completed, with a focus on firewall configuration using `iptables`.  
The lab demonstrates both **technical skills** and **practical alignment to GRC frameworks**.

---

## Lab Purpose

- Configure inbound and outbound firewall rules on Linux servers.  
- Enforce **least privilege access** for SSH, HTTP, and other protocols.  
- Learn to verify firewall rules for **audit-ready evidence**.  
- Focused on **hands-on system configuration**.

---

## Initiative Taken

During this lab, I took the initiative to:

- Map firewall configurations to **ISO 27001:2022 Annex A** and **NIST SP 800-53** controls.  
- List **possible risks mitigated** by the implemented controls.  
- Capture **audit evidence** by verifying rules using `iptables -L -v --line-numbers`.  

This demonstrates **technical proficiency and GRC awareness**.

---

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Enforced **access control guardrails** at the system level.  
- Applied **DROP and ACCEPT rules** to reduce the attack surface.  
- Mapped firewall configurations to **compliance controls**.  
- Provided **audit-ready outputs** for review and documentation.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **linux-iptables/** — Directory containing the lab files:  
  - `Linux Firewall Configuration with iptables.md` — Detailed lab write-up including summary, lessons learned, compliance mapping, risks mitigated, and key takeaways.  
  - `Commands Used.md` — Full list of commands executed during the lab.  
  - `evidence/` — Subdirectory containing screenshots of the lab showing command outputs and verification.

This repository demonstrates both **hands-on Linux firewall configuration** and the ability to **align technical work with governance, risk, and compliance frameworks**.
