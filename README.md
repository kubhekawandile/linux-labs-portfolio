# Linux Labs Portfolio

This repository contains documentation of various Linux labs I have completed.  
Each lab is organized in its respective directory and includes detailed write-ups, commands used, and evidence such as screenshots.  

The purpose of this repo is to showcase hands-on Linux skills, practical system configuration experience, and alignment with security and compliance best practices.
