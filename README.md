# Linux Labs Portfolio

This repository contains documentation of various Linux labs I have completed.  
Each lab is organized in its respective directory and includes detailed write-ups, commands used, and evidence such as screenshots.  

The purpose of this repo is to showcase hands-on Linux skills, practical system configuration experience, and alignment with security and compliance best practices.
## How to Navigate This Repository

Each lab is organized in its own directory.  
Inside each lab directory, you will find:  

- A detailed **write-up** explaining the lab objectives, steps taken, lessons learned, and compliance mapping where applicable.  
- A **Commands Used** file containing all the CLI commands executed during the lab.  
- An **evidence** folder containing screenshots of command outputs and verification steps.  

This structure allows you to explore each lab independently and understand both the technical implementation and practical outcomes.
